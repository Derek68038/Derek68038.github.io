Start of week 3!

It's been a little while since my last entry. We've been pretty busy over the last week. We had out first project where we collaborated with another student. That went pretty well I thought. Getting into some HTML and CSS stuff now, which seems way less complex than Ruby. 

To answer what is software development as I understand it so far; in short, I believe it's creating meaninful, functional code which requires the least amount of developer input and manipulation, and takes the shortest path possible in order to fulfill what it was written to do. Not sure that makes a lot of sense, but I'm sure that viewpoint will change as class progresses. For moving parts, in terms of real world application, I believe there's few. A developer team, the language(s) they use, and the work orders (or clients/projects they work on/for). If you were to peel the layers off those three, you'd definitely see far more moving parts, but as a group, I believe it's a fair assessment. 

One reason working with a pair is valuable is because it enables you to see how another person breaks down the problem and goes about solving it. With my partner in the warehouse project, I felt that we went about solving a lot of things in different ways but it was great to see another approach so I can use certain things in the future when I'm stuck on a problem.
