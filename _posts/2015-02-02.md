Snow Day!
---

So today was a snow day, meaning the classroom was closed and we all worked from home. Personally, I think the idea of working from home outweighs the functionality of it. There were so many messages going on in Slack today that it almost became more of a distraction than anything else. I'd much rather be able to interact face to face with my classmates and instructors. Being at home kind of made the day feel longer and not as interesting as compared to being in the classroom. I think having a position where you would work at home every day would be a bit of a struggle for me at first to transition to that type of work day. I believe I could do it but if I had the choice, I think I would choose otherwise. It was a good thing to experience though today.
