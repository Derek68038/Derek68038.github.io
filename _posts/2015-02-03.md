Today's journal entry is over the difference between a gem and an API. Before today I wasn't really familiar with either of these terms, so I'll be honest in saying that I still don't have a clear enough understanding in them where I could explain all the differences. I know you can install gem's in order to obtain public methods that other user's have posted. An API on the otherhand gives you access to a database full of various information. In other words, I can only go up in my understanding of the two.
